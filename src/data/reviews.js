    review:
      "I took my daughter on an airplane Discovery Flight and we both loved it. She even got to handle the controls during the lesson! If we lived nearby, she would definitely take flight training from High Tide Aviation. Willis was a great instructor and a huge encouragement to her. Now, I want to do it!",
