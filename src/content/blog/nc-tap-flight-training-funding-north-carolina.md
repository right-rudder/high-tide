Pursuing flight training is an exciting step toward an aviation career—but for many aspiring pilots, **cost can be the biggest barrier**. High Tide Aviation, we’re always looking for ways to help students make training more accessible.

That’s why we’re excited to share an important opportunity: the **North Carolina Tuition Assistance Program (NC-TAP)**. Applications open **January 1st**, and eligible students can receive funding to help cover the cost of flight training.

## What Is the North Carolina Tuition Assistance Program (NC-TAP)?

The **North Carolina Tuition Assistance Program (NC-TAP)** is a **state-funded tuition reimbursement program** designed to support students pursuing high-demand technical careers—and aviation is one of them.

If you qualify and are enrolled in an approved program, NC-TAP can help reimburse a portion of your flight training expenses. This support can make a meaningful difference in reducing out-of-pocket costs while you work toward your pilot certificates and ratings.

## Why NC-TAP Matters for Aspiring Pilots

Flight training is an investment in your future, but financial concerns often delay or prevent students from starting. NC-TAP helps remove that obstacle by offering funding support for eligible North Carolina residents.

With NC-TAP, qualified applicants may receive assistance while training toward:

- **Private Pilot Certificate**
- **Instrument Rating**
- **Commercial Pilot Certificate**

This program allows students to focus on training, skill development, and safety—rather than financial stress—while moving confidently toward an aviation career.

## Important Dates to Remember

Timing is critical when applying for NC-TAP.
